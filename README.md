# City Explorer

This is a week two project from Code Fellows 301 with the introduction of APIs.
**Author**: Jonathan Brock
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This is the first introduction to APIs during the Code Fellows 301 class.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:
01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
